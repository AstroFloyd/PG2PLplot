PG2PLplot README

The idea of this library is to facilitate the transition from Fortran code linked 
against PGPlot to linking it against PLplot, which is open source and maintained.
Currently, many PGPlot routines are included, but the code is by no means exhaustive.
One-to-one translation is sometimes perfectly possible, sometimes difficult, and
sometimes impossible.  In the first case, the code should run without any problems
(even though for instance the line style or pen colour may be somewhat different),
in the second case an imperfect translation is silently done, in the third case the
code will warn that no translation exists.

You can either build and link against the library, or include the source file in
your code. To download the PG2PLplot package, to read the code documentation, or to 
contact the developers, see: 
See http://pg2plplot.sourceforge.net/



INSTALLATION:

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.


USAGE:

After installation, you should typically do something like this to use your code 
containing PGPlot calls with PLplot:

  gfortran -lplplotf95d -lplplotf95cd -lpg2plplot code.f90 -o program

If you are using CMake, you can use FindPG2PLplot.cmake and CMakeLocations.cmake
from CMakeFiles (cmakefiles.sf.net).
